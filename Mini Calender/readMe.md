# Mini Calendar

## Overview
This is a simple Mini Calendar web app that displays the current month, day of the week, date, and year.  
It is built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

## Inspiration
The idea and functionality for this project were inspired by [100 JS Projects - Mini Calendar](https://www.100jsprojects.com/project/mini-calendar).  
While the core logic is similar, I created my own design and layout using TailwindCSS and custom styles.

## Features
- Shows the current month, day, date, and year.
- Responsive and modern design using TailwindCSS.
- Uses JavaScript's `Date` object for dynamic updates.
- Custom visual style and layout.

## How It Works
- The JavaScript file (`index.js`) gets the current date and updates the calendar display.
- The HTML structure is styled with TailwindCSS for a clean, modern look.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The calendar will automatically show the current date information.
